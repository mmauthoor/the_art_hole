## Technologies & installation
A server-side CRUD application written in Ruby, HTML and CSS and populated with data from a PSQL database. 
- User images are hosted by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). 
- Passwords are encrypted with [BCrypt Ruby](https://github.com/bcrypt-ruby/bcrypt-ruby)
- CSS/layout (including some JavaScript for cosmetic purposes) enabled by Bootstrap 5.

Best viewed on Chrome or Safari (or anything other than IE).

## Unsolved issues/fixes needed
- Server-side code for handling the following scenarios seems long-winded and needs work: PUT /users/:id route when a user updates their details but not their password; PUT artworks/:id route when a user updates artwork details but not the artwork file itself. 
- By necessity, the main gallery carousel only shows part of an image, which is an issue if the image is portrait orientation. Further research require to see if there's a better solution for this. 
- Responsiveness needs to be improved, particularly for the navbar.
- Further refactoring to clean up the HTML and CSS and optimise Bootstrap use.
- The SQL query for selecting a random artwork from the database as the front page featured artwork is adequate for small databases but would take too long to execute in a large database. 

## Areas of future work
- Artwork listings would have a 'Sold' button that would update the listing as sold via the database. Recently sold artworks could appear underneath the carousel in the main gallery.
- Ideally would have a 'trending artwork' method that checks the database for the top 3 artworks with the most watchers, then populates a 'Highly sought after' area in the main gallery with those pieces.
- Featured artwork on front page would ideally be linked to a timer so it changes daily rather than when the page is refreshed.
